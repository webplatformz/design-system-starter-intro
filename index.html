            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>React app uses the Design System React wrappers and Tailwind preset</li>
                <li>Design System gets published to the internal registry upon tagging commit with a version</li>
                <li>Chromatic is run on the main branch and changes regularly get checked by UX</li>
                <li>local linking of Web Components from the React app possible for development (using <a
                        href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-link">npm link</a>)
                </li>
                <li>merged stories get tested by UX on the test environment</li>

            <ul>
                <li>setup easy to understand and use</li>
                <li>consistent styling in components and throughout the app</li>
                <li>clear communication between development and UX</li>
                <li>accountability to both development and UX to be aligned with each other and with the defined token</li>
                <li>low effort to build simple parts of the UI</li>
                <li>easy to add, extend and adapt components</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Experience: the not quite as great stuff</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>missing changelog</li>
                <li>hard to find/prevent side effects from changes sometimes in the app itself</li>
                <li>added round-trip time to implement a story if changes in Web Components are needed</li>
                <li>Chromatic only on the main branch after merging as we only use the free tier, which has a limit on the snapshots per month</li>
